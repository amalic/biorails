    <p>
      A user request is composed of a list of items
      (such as compounds, samples or targets) to be
      submitted for processing against a list of services.
      In the request the user may add new items and
      services over time if the initial request cascades
      to produce further work. As such, the request
      lifespan can be run for the length of the project
      rather than as a number of one-offs.
