A user request is composed of a list of items (such as compounds, samples or targets) to be submitted to for processing against a list of services.
In the request the user may add new items and services over time if the initial request cascades to 
produce further work. As such, the request lifespan can be run for the length of the project rather than as a number of one-offs.
