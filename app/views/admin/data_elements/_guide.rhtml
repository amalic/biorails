      <h3> Data Element </h3>
      This is a physical implementation of a concept used in the system. This may be internal to the database of linked to
      external data source. In general a element provides a list of id,name elements for use in lookups elsewhere in the system.
      The following Types of element may be defined:-

      <h4>Lists [Internal]</h4>
      <p> This is a <strong>comma</strong> separated list of values with string is speach marks like 'Male','Female' or numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6 or mixed 1,2,3,3,4,'NA' but not '1.2' or "$Â£". These values are stored as a set of child data elements in the system. <i>Remember to quote strings!</i>
      </p>

      <h4>Models [Internal]</h4>
      <p>
      This is the name of a model class to use as a source of a list of values. This is commonly used for internal inventory
              and links between items, examples would be a reference assay or experiment name that needs to be entered.
      </p>
      <h4>Views [Internal/External]</h4>
      <p>
      This is used to dynamically link to a table or view in another systems. Most commonly this
      is used for external inventory and links to predefined lookup tables from other systems. The source
      view must have a single unique column called 'id' and column called 'name' for use in lookups.
      </p>
      <h4>Sql Select [Internal/External]</h4>
      <p>
      This is a simple SQL select statement returning at minimum a 'id' and 'name' columns for use. The
      statement should not involve orders or groups (Use views for theses). As in use a "and id=nnn" or
      " and name like'xxx'" may be appended.
      </p>
