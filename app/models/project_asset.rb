# ProjectAsset is the gatekeeping between internally kept data and external files. In initial version the application
# server file system is used for storage but it is expected that the following may be added as neededd:-
# 
#  * Subversion 
#  * In Database blobs
#  * Web Service to document/file management systems
#  * Link to 3rd part applications like ELN's
