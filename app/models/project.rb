# This is the only web root path and investigation log for project.
# The Projects is build of organizational elements (Studies/Protocols/Services)
# execution elements covering the capture of data (experiments/tasks)
# and documentation build of a number of sections containing articles,assets,comments,reports etc.
# 
# Then the whole system is split into a internal view managed my members of the project and a public view 
# seen by subscribers.
