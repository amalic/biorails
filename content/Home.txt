===== Finder, the place to start! =====
{{/home/thawkins/shared/biorails/public/icons/arrow_left.png}} The best place to start is the [[FinderPanel]] on the right.  Type the first few letters of thing you are looking in the [[SearchBox]] and the finder will present you with a list of categorized hits.
===== Overview =====
[[BioRails]] is a study management system for preclinical researchers.  It is designed to help the biologist and pharmacologist organize Studies and execute experiments and tasks within them as well as providing a platform for annotation and reporting. The application organized into the header with high level menus or [[DomainTabs]], A [[FinderPanel]] for finding records and tasks, [[CenterContents]] for the record browsing and user operations and a [[ContextPanel]] which provides extra detail for the [[CurrentRecord]]. 
The basic organization is that records identified in the finder will open on the correct [[DomainTabs]] and the [[DataLens]] provides a //special// way of interacting with that record. 
==== Domains ====
The [[DomainTabs]] across the top of the page provide the high level organization for BioRails.  We will describe each domain in turn:
  1 [[Home]] - System Overview
  2 [[MyHome]] - My pages
  3 [[Inventory]] - //stuff// used in studies.  This //stuff// is defined during the installation but tends to be used for compound, plates and samples.
  4 [[Study]] - where the Study is set up and organized.  
  5 Experiment - the place where experiments, assays or, in fact any processes are run.
  6 [[Catalogue]] ([[AdminRole]])- the glue for all the different systems into which [[BioRails]] is integrated.
  7 Configuration  ([[AdminRole]])- system configuration such as users
