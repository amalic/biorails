The Catalogue is the place where all the different systems supporting and dependent on [[BioRails]] are //glued// together.  In the Catalogue we describe the  
===== Context =====

The Context contains a registry of contextual namespace using the DSL (Domain Specific Language) for the different //areas// [[BioRails]] has been implemented in.  We need to rename this context to [[DiscoveryResearc]]h and include other examples such as [[ClinicalResearch]], [[CompoundScreening]] etc.
===== Systems =====
External systems are tied into [[BioRails]] through the 'Systems' form.  An external system is simply a data source that has not been defined in the BioRails model.  Examples could be a compound database, inventory system, user rights and authentication, taxonomic databases or //master// protocol management systems.  BioRails supports multiple concurrent systems which means that testing can be carried out on different sources of inventory for example. 
== ParameterTypes ==
Parameters are the classic dictionaries in BioRails.  [[ParameterTypes]] provide the structure for queries and cover the actual usage of results, conditions, settings or whatever roles have been described in [[ParameterRoles]].

h1.  The Catalogue

h2. Overview

The catalogue is a sophisticated and powerful dictionary management system.  From here conceptual namespaces can be defined, multiple systems linked in and ontologies can be mapped between the corporate standards and local usages.  The catalogue also provides the building blocks for the creation of studies and running experiments.
