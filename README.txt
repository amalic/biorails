This is the last version of biorails released under under GNU license. After this point work for 4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3 
has concentrated on enterprise version of product with Oracle, Microsoft Office integration and support for 
Internet explorer. 

If you are interested in biorails I would suggest looking on our http://edge-ka.com site and look at the newer versions. 
Afraid this version is now very old, and is more a historic reference point.
