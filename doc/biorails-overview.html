<H1 CLASS="western">Overview</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Biorails is aimed as helping in the
management of projects with data capture of structured data ,linked
to a stong set of content management features to enable the anonation
of captured data and presentation of texual and image data. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As a systems is really splits down into
a number of separate parts.</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Catalogue</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Project Folders</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Inventory of materials</P>

</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In version 1.0 the focus was simple web
based data capture, in the current version 2.0 management of projects
and unstructured data was added to round out the product. Now is is
based seen a project folder based data capture front-end. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Catalogue</H2>
<P>This is the system administrator workstop.  The key change there
is the management of lookups and links to remove systems. The system
is built with integration in mind and the catalogue is the key point
for definition of read only references to other systems. It is
expected that most inventory and some other key lookups will be
defined in other systems.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Data Concept 
</H3>
<P>This namespace represents a tree of concepts describing the
business data. By default a initial Biorails namespace is provided to
work in.  This Conceptual namespace is used to define the general
framework for catagorization of data. Concepts would be items like :-</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Colour</P>
	<LI><P>Compound</P>
</UL>
<P>Concepts are linked to parameter types defined by the
administrator to limit the list of lookup the user can use for a
parameter. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Data Element</H3>
<P>This is  actual implementation of these concepts has been
separated out as Data element. These provide simple lookup list
implementation of concept. The separation may initially seem like
overkill, but is aimed at address the key problem multiple
implementation. For the example of same samples, there may be
implementation my compounds, external compound, natural products. 
nitially the following styles of lookup list can be defined as a Data
Element</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>lists (simple 1,2,3,4 style lists managed internally)</P>
	<LI><P>models ( in Coded Ruby models)</P>
	<LI><P>SQL Views (Named table or views in systems)</P>
	<LI><P>SQL select (Hand crafted SQL selects)</P>
</UL>
<P>In use these would be thinks</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Colours in english</P>
	<LI><P>Internal registered compounds</P>
</UL>
<H3 CLASS="western">Data System</H3>
<P>The implementation of any Data Element is based on the rules
defined in Data System. This defines how to connect and talk to the
system. In concept there is a Initial internal systems (biorails this
self) then other remote database schema can be registered for use as
read only lookup. Currenlty this supports
Oracle,MySql,Postgres,Sqlite databases.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Parameter Type</P>
<P>These are global data dimesnion for structured data entered by the
scientist. At this level the administration can define key metrics
for transfer to long term data warehouse and</P>
<P>For a sceening operation this would be something like the
followig:-</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>IC50</P>
	<LI><P>Inhibition</P>
	<LI><P>Dose</P>
	<LI><P>Compound</P>
	<LI><P>Plate</P>
	<LI><P>Identifer</P>
	<LI><P>RawData</P>
	<P>On the plus side comparied to may other systems is scientists can
	alias these at the study level. So say display and use ABS and not
	RawData in the UI.</P>
	<P>Parameter Roles</P>
</UL>
<P>These are used to partition the parameters be used so a subset can
be easliet picked up for further use. As present the systems comes
with a default list of :-</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Results</P>
	<LI><P>Setting</P>
	<LI><P>Condition</P>
	<LI><P>Measure</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Project</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This deals wiith the general
partitioning of work and access control. Access to a project is
controlled via membership, only members see or know a project exists
in the front end. The project is moduled on the idea of a folders to
match how many people organization there. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The system automatically created
folders for each study design and experiment run as part of the
project. People can also create other folder to hold notes, files and
links to specific items in biorails. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Folders can contains the following:-</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Articles, html texual content</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Asserts, external images, files
	etc</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">References, these are links to
	other items in biorails (like tasks, reports etc)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">sub Folders 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As a general rule articles/assets  are
versioned to changes over time can be tasked. This is a general
approach taken throughout the application.  Folders can be used in a
number of ways:-</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Directories like file system</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Component Documents with each
	element chained together</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Blogs where items are display in
	reverse order of time</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"></P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">One of the aims of the folder was to
allow easy reuse of blocks of text in report. With this aim the
systems allow simple drag and drop of items into a folder and there
reordering to create a long document or report.   
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Items like studies, experiments,task as
automatic rendering so they can be simply dropped on into a folder to
get a summary of there details in the document. Also the inbuilt
simple report builder/runner allows the saving of a report to as a
article. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Inventory</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">At present this areas is filled by
simple default implementation for common inventories. In most cases
there is likily to be some customization to integrate with other
systems here unless you only need simple compounds, batch etc. In
fact implimentation of new inventory types is possibilty the best
intoduction to rails coding in biorails.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Ogranization</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This deals with study designs and can
be split into three parts as follows:- 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Parameter space</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Services provided</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Protocol Definitions</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Parameters</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This is the usage of a parameter type
with a predefined Lookup or Format. In the study design the scientist
gets to define the list of parameters they use, based on the
catalogue. This is a process of selecting and parameter type,
chosening the format , default units and lookup to use and finally
alias if  needed.  The allow a parameter type like RawData to be
converted into a more defined definition like   like rate in unit of
cpm with format double 5.2.  This add validation rules and units to
data.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Services</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This is basically a named queue for a
type of data element acepted into the study. Examples could be a
queue of plates or samples. This is the forefilement side of
requesting and allows the external services provided my a study to be
defined in terms of stuff that is sent to it.  For items on a service
queue can then be mantained (accepted,rejected etc) by a member of
the project with the correct rights.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Protocols</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This is basically a number of linked
grouping of parameters (contexts in biorails tems). The context a
linked in a tree to generate more complex parent/child trees if
needed.  This allows the system to easily build complex data entry
tree / grid like plate-&gt;compound-&gt;well. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For people more used to older more
limited systems like excel templates this can be simply viewed  in
terms a context as a  row and parameter as a  column in sheet and to
define them parameters are dragged from a tree to column headering.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This is a extra important link to
queues here. As in a queue linked parameter is used in a column then
as items are added as the protocol in run in a task then the
queue_items are linked and automatically updated to match the task
status. This is aimed a getting the software do to the hard work of
maintaining the current status of all requested items</P>
