This is the basic user rights plugin for biorails. It used controller based access control list approach to security.
For a control

authorized_actions << :show <<:edit << :new << :destroy


helpers

 * has_permission?(subject,action)
 * link_to_authorized( ..same as link_to.. )

controller
 
  * has_permission?(subject,action) => true/false
  * acl(user) =>Permisisons[] 
  * ace(user,subject,action) = RolePermision
  
model
This is setup via 

  * acts_as_authenticated

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_authenticated
end

Generates:-

  * username/username=
  * password/password=
  * authorize(params[])
  * authorized?
  * has_permission?(subject,action) => true/false
  * acl =>Permisisons[] 
  * ace(subject,action) = RolePermision
