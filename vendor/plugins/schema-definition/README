== Schema Definition

A Ruby on Rails plugin for easy migration generation.
Based on Auto-Migrations by PJ Hyett [ pjhyett@gmail.com ].

== Usage

Create a copy of your schema.rb file and name it definition.rb.
Now, when you need to change database schema, edit definition.rb file.
Then, invoke

  $ ruby/script generate migration 

It will generate a new migration with all differencies of definition.rb 
against your current database schema! You can migrate immediately, or add some
more tweaks to your migration, or something else.

Why is it great? Because you don't need to remember all that syntax like
change_column, add_column, etc - you just modify your schema (in file definition.rb).

Nice bonus: migrations are automatically named (of course you may override name suggested).

== How to install

ruby script/plugin install http://schema-definition.googlecode.com/svn/tags/stable/schema-definition

== Todo

Indices are partially supported at the moment.

== Changelog
