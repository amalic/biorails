This is licenced under GNU 2.0 lience to match the CDK library it is dependent upon

The initial idea for this code came from http://rubyforge.org/projects/rcdk 
and pieces on http://depth-first.com . In the end ended up with a reimplementation the code
for CDK 1.0.1 and changes to create generate for rails models based for 
chemical aware objects. 

Big change withthis library v.s. RCK is focus on rails model and coverage basic
structure operaitons SSS, Match, Fingerprint so a simple example registration
system can be built with it.  

I have attempt provide the standard features needed for registration as best as possible with 
open source libraries. So taht peiople can  built to allow basic inventory management 
in a chemical aware way in rails.

Overview of functions in Alces::Chemistrt:CDK :-

 Searching
     sss     true is this is subgraph
     match   true is molecules are then same

 Fingerprints
     fingerprint  generate finderprint
     subset       fingerprint screen passed for sss
     tanimoto     how simular are molecules

 Calculation
     formula
     canonical_mass
     natural_mass
     exact_mass

 Layout
    Layout_2d
    Layout_3d

Conversions
     to_smiles
     from_smiles
     to_molfile
     from_molecule
     read(data,format)
     write(format)
     to_png
     to_jpg
     to_svg
     
The chemical seraching will be a little slow as SSS and match are only implemented 
in the client codeand not linked to database functions. Also depictions from smiles 
may not be as good and some of the commerial offering. If you want nice depictions
your have to save coordinates in the database via MolFile. 

On the plus side this is release under GNU license is open for enhancement. Also
for commerial biorails.com offering will be implementing same API in better $$
chemistry tools.
