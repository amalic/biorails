help_articles:  Guide to Articles
help_articles_text:  Articles are formatted text which supports cut and paste from word. For secure browsers you may need to enable browser paste into the window. Each edit of an article is saved to thus maintainined a complete history
help_catalogue:  <p>The catalogue is used to define the data dictionaries used in this system. The dictionaries are organised into a hierarchical set of concepts, a conceptual namespace. </p><br /><p>Each concept is abstract but can be implemented with multiple lookups. A parameter type or usage can be declared with a conept providing the scientist with a filtered list of lookups to select from when adding the parameter type to an assay definition.</p>
help_catalogue2:  This process can be used to transfer a catalogue from an existing system, thus providing a mechanism for setting up clean databases for example. There are a set of supporting rake tasks to extend this functionality.
help_concept_usage:  Declaring a <i>Usage</i> of a concept automatically adds the concept as a dictionary based <i>Parameter Type</i>. A <i>Usage</i> will present all the lookups at the level of the current concept and its children as options when adding this parameter type to an assay.
help_data_systems:  Data systems are connections to databases database/schemas and are used to support the lookups of of the concept implementations.
help_element:  Unstructured data in the domain is divided up into a number of section. Each section may work as a folder, blog or a component document.
help_experiment:  An Experiment is a logical grouping of Tasks and holds all the steps involved in running an assay's workflow.
help_filter_based_on:  This table is based on filtered data from the following
help_filtering_sorting_rules:  Extensive functionality is supported by right-clicking on the report column headers including sorting, grouping and re-ordering columns. Filtering is also available on enabled columns with wildcard support... &#37; and &#60; and &#62;.
help_import_csv:  Re-import the CSV file via this file selector
help_import_task:  This is a simple CSV file-importer for importing large blocks of data into the system. The procedure is to export a CSV template, usually opened in a spreadsheet. Add the data, save the file and re-import the file.
help_parameter_roles:  Parameter roles describe how parameters are catagorised in an assay definition.
help_parameter_type:  Parameter types define a <i>class</i> of data that can be captured within the system. Each parameter type can be aliased either formally (click on the the name) or when added to an assay definition.
help_process_building:  Process Building
help_process_building_full:  <p>Creation of a new process is a 2 step operation.</p><ol style='list-styledecimal inside'><li>A process is given a name and a description (minimum)</li><li>A <i>layout</i> is created from the assay's parameters to define the <i>data entry sheet</i>.</li></ol>
help_projects:  This is a list of domains to which you have access.
help_recipe:  A recipe is used to create an experiment workflow. A workflow recipe is composed of a collection of released process versions. These processes can be from the parent assay definition or from other definitions linked to the domain
help_recipe:  Once a parameter assigned to a process, it is bound to a queue. Active <i>queue items</i> will be automatically linked to the next task they are used in. When the status of that task changes to complete, the queue items linked to it are updated automatically, thus returning the <i>results</i> to the original request. It is also possible to manually trigger this process by pressing one of the update buttons.
help_recipe_creation_problem:  A <i>Recipe</i> cannot be created until there is at least one released <i>Process</i> available either in this assay definition or made available to the domain...
help_report_building:  
help_request:  A request is built of a list of materails (queue-items) submitted for processing against one or more services. In the request the user may add new materials and services over time if the initial request cascades to produce further work.
help_request:  A user request is composed of a list of items (such as compounds, samples or targets) to be submitted for processing against a list of services. In the request the user may add new items and services over time if the initial request cascades to produce further work. As such, the request lifespan can be run for the length of the domain rather than as a number of one-offs.
help_request_service:  The items submitted through a request to a specific service within an assay.
help_service:  Queues are used to manage materials submitted to the services defined within an assay. The items in a queue all have the same parameter type and are awaiting a service. So for example a cue of mice awaiting weighing will all have a parameter type of mass.
help_states:  State workflows can be described for a number of different entities. Each state has a corresponding internal meaning and the workflow describes which states can follow.
help_user_home:  This is a user focused dasboard providing a portal to the data captured in the system.
