  body_html: <p>A <strong>DNase footprinting assay</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=3773731&amp;query_hl=8" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=3773731&amp;query_hl=8" class="external autonumber">[1]</a>is a technique from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology" title="Molecular biology">molecular biology</a> that detects <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a> interaction using the fact that a protein bound to DNA will often protect that DNA from enzymatic cleavage. The method uses an enzyme, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribonuclease" title="Deoxyribonuclease">deoxyribonuclease</a> (DNase, for short) to cut the radioactively end-labelled DNA, followed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis" title="Gel electrophoresis">gel electrophoresis</a> to detect the resulting cleavage pattern.</p> <p>For example, the DNA fragment of interest may be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction" title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</a> amplified using a <sup>32</sup>P 5&#39; labelled primer, with the end result being many DNA molecules with a radioactive label on one end of one strand of each double stranded molecule. Cleavage by DNase will produce fragments, the smaller of which will move further on the electrophoretic gel. The fragments which are smaller with respect to the <sup>32</sup>P-labelled end will appear further on the gel than the longer fragments. The gel is then used to expose a special photographic film.</p> <p>The cleavage pattern of the DNA in the absence of a DNA binding protein, typically referred to as free DNA, is compared to the cleavage pattern of DNA in the presence of a DNA binding protein. If the protein binds DNA, the binding site is protected from enzymatic cleavage. This protection will result in a clear area on the gel which is referred to as the &quot;footprint&quot;.</p> <p><br /> By varying the concentration of the DNA-binding protein, the binding affinity of the protein can be estimated according to the minimum concentration of protein at which a footprint is observed.</p>

  body_html: <p>In biochemistry, one of the ways to learn about an interaction between two molecules is to determine the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_constant" title="Binding constant">binding constant</a>, which is a number that describes the ratio of unbound and bound molecules. This information reveals the affinity between the two molecules and allows prediction of the amount bound given any set of initial conditions.</p> <p>In order to measure a binding constant, one must find a way to measure the amount of complex formed over a range of starting concentrations. This can be achieved by &quot;labeling&quot; one of the species with a florescent, or in this case, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive" title="Radioactive">radioactive</a> tag. The DNA is &quot;labeled&quot; by the addition of radioactive Phosphate derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_Triphosphate" title="Adenosine Triphosphate">Adenosine Triphosphate</a>.</p> <p>A <strong>filter binding assay</strong> is a simple way to quickly study many samples. It measures <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity" title="Affinity">affinities</a> between two molecules (often protein and DNA) using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_%28chemistry%29" title="Filter (chemistry)">filter</a>. The filter is constructed of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nitrocellulose_paper&amp;action=edit" title="Nitrocellulose paper" class="new">nitrocellulose paper</a>, which is negatively charged. Since most proteins have a net positive charge, nitrocellulose paper is ideal for immobilizing proteins. DNA is negatively charged due to the phosphate backbone and will not &quot;stick&quot; to the nitrocellulose on its own, however, any DNA that has been bound by protein will stick. The exact amount of DNA &quot;stuck&quot; to the nitrocellulose is quantified by measuring the amount of radioactivity on the filter using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillation_counter" title="Scintillation counter">scintillation counter</a></p> <p>Protein and DNA are mixed in a series of microfuge tubes in which the amount of DNA is kept constant, but the amount of protein is incrementally increased. These samples are allowed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equilibrate&amp;action=edit" title="Equilibrate" class="new">equilibrate</a>. After equliibration, an equal volume from each tube is squirted onto small, round, nitrocellulose filters which are arranged on a vacuum plate (a flat surface that has a vacuum applied from below to suck fluid downward). All of the protein will stick, but only the protein that has bound DNA will register in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillation_counter" title="Scintillation counter">scintillation counter</a>.</p> <p>Now, you will have a number that describes the amount of DNA bound for each concentration of protein used, this information can be plotted on a binding curve to determine the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_constant" title="Binding constant">binding constant</a>.</p>

  body_html: "<p>An <strong>electrophoretic mobility shift assay</strong> (EMSA), also referred as a <strong>gel shift assay</strong> or <strong>band shift assay</strong> or <strong>gel retardation assay</strong> , is a common technique used to study <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein\" title=\"Protein\">protein</a>-<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA\" title=\"DNA\">DNA</a> or protein-<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA\" title=\"RNA\">RNA</a> interactions. This procedure can determine if a protein or mixture of proteins is capable of binding to a given DNA or RNA sequence, and can sometimes indicate if more than one protein molecule is involved in the binding complex. Gel shift assays are often performed in vitro concurrently with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNase_footprinting\" title=\"DNase footprinting\">DNase footprinting</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_extension\" title=\"Primer extension\">primer extension</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Promoter-probe&amp;action=edit\" title=\"Promoter-probe\" class=\"new\">promoter-probe</a> experiments when studying <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_%28genetics%29\" title=\"Transcription (genetics)\">transcription</a> initiation.</p> <p><a id=\"Principle\" name=\"Principle\" title=\"Principle\"></a></p> <h2><span class=\"editsection\">[<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electrophoretic_mobility_shift_assay&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Principle\">edit</a>]</span> <span class=\"mw-headline\">Principle</span></h2> <p>A mobility shift assay generally involves <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis\" title=\"Gel electrophoresis\">electrophoretic separation</a> of a protein-DNA mixture on a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyacrylamide_gel\" title=\"Polyacrylamide gel\">polyacrylamide</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agarose_gel\" title=\"Agarose gel\">agarose</a> gel for a short period. The speed at which different molecules (and combinations thereof) move through the gel is determined by their size and charge, and to a lesser extent, their shape (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis\" title=\"Gel electrophoresis\">Gel electrophoresis</a>). The control lane without protein present will contain a single band corresponding to the unbound DNA fragment. However, assuming the protein is capable of binding to the DNA fragment, the lane with protein present will contain another band that represents the larger complex of DNA bound to protein. From the ratio of bound to unbound DNA, the affinity of the protein to the DNA sequence may be determined.</p> <p>Often, an extra lane is run with a competitor oligonucleotide to determine the most favorable binding sequence for the binding protein. The use of different oligonucleotides of defined sequence allows the identification of the precise binding site by competition. (Not shown in diagram). Variants of the competition assay are useful for measuring the specificity of binding and for measurement of association and dissociation kinetics.</p> <p>For visualization purposes, the DNA fragment is usually labeled with a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive\" title=\"Radioactive\">radioactive</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent\" title=\"Fluorescent\">fluorescent</a> label, as standard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethidium_bromide\" title=\"Ethidium bromide\">ethidium bromide</a> staining lacks the sensitivity to detect the relatively small amounts of DNA used in these experiments.</p> "
