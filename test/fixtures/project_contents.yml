    &nbsp;Moose are long-legged and heavy bodied with a
    drooping nose, a "bell" or dewlap under the chin, and a small tail.
    Their color ranges from golden brown to almost black, depending
    upon the season and the age of the animal. The hair of newborn
    calves is generally red-brown fading to a lighter rust color within
    a few weeks. Newborn calves weigh 28 to 35 pounds (13-16 kg) and
    within five months grow to over 300 pounds (136 kg). Males in prime
    condition weigh from 1,200 to 1,600 pounds (542-725 kg). Adult
    females weigh 800 to 1,300 pounds (364-591 kg). Only the bulls have
    antlers. The largest moose antlers in North America come from
    Alaska, the Yukon Territory, and the Northwest Territories of
    Canada. Trophy class bulls are found throughout Alaska, but the
    largest come from the western portion of the state. Moose
    occasionally produce trophy-size antlers when they are 6 or 7 years
    old, with the largest antlers grown at approximately 10 to 12 years
    of age. In the wild, moose rarely live more than 16 years.

As soon as they have all the kinks out, Terracotta will put the configuration into a Terracotta config module. <p>Eelco Hillenius writes about the <a href="http://chillenious.wordpress.com/2007/04/07/terracotta-supports-subtype-expressions">changes that have taken place</a> in both Wicket and Terracotta to make configuring Wicket fairly easy, as well as descibing what configuration is needed for Wicket. Wicket was modified to have a tagging interface for all classes that need to be tracked by Terracotta. In Terracotta they added a feature that had existed previously but been removed or never committed to the mainline, to allow matching on subtypes of a class or interface when including classes to be monitored by Terracotta. </p> <p>Hillenius notes that the last remaining piece is proper support of Wicket&#39;s EnumeratedType.  </p> </body> </html>

    &nbsp;During fall and winter, moose consume large quantities
    of willow, birch, and aspen twigs. In some areas, moose actually
    establish a "hedge" or browse line 6 to 8 feet above the ground by
    clipping most of the terminal shoots of favored food species.
    Spring is the time of grazing as well as browsing. Moose eat a
    variety of foods, particularly sedges, equisetum (horsetail), pond
    weeds, and grasses. During summer, moose feed on vegetation in
    shallow ponds, forbs, and the leaves of birch, willow, and aspen.

    "I live near Hoback Junction, Wyoming, eight miles south of Jackson
    Hole and just the other day my roommates and I noticed two moose in our
    yard. We believe them to be a Momma and a yearling! We often see then
    grazing trees in our yard but recently we heard a huge thud on our
    porch during the night and looked out to find the momma moose using our
    porch to try to reach a tree branch. I couldn't help but open the door
    and stick my arm outside to try and grab a picture but it was too dark
    so I gave up and we all sat by the window gawking in amazement! She is
    so beautiful! Her yearling, though also gorgeous, is completely bald on
    her rump and I was wondering if this is normal. It looks as if she has
    a parasite or disease and was wondering if she's okay or if I should
    contact someone? I do have some pictures from afar that I could send if
    you would like to see them. I also wanted to tell you that I was
    researching this and came upon your site and think that it's WONDERFUL!
    Thanks for all you do and take care! Molly."

    the state. At one time professional hunters supplied moose meat to\n\
    mining camps. Historically, moose were an important source of food,\n\
    clothing, and implements to Athapaskan Indians dwelling along the\n\
    major rivers. Today, Alaskans and nonresidents annually harvest\n\
    approximately 6,000 to 8,000 moose\xE2\x80\x94some 3.5 million pounds of\n\

    tourists photograph those animals that feed along the highway.\n\n\
    </p><p>Man's developments in Alaska include many alterations upon the face\n\

Spring is the time of grazing as well as browsing. Moose eat a variety of foods, particularly sedges, equisetum (horsetail), pond weeds, and grasses.

A <em>thread</em> is an execution path in the program that has its own local variables, program counter, and lifetime. If the task being executed on the thread takes a long time, there needs to be a mechanism to stop, monitor, pause, and resume the task.</p>  <!-- me -->  <p>This article will take a nontrivial example with threads and refactor the code to include these capabilities. This article assumes a basic understanding of threads and some knowledge of SWING programming. A zip file is provided for download at the end.</p>  <h3>A Nontrivial Example</h3>  <p>Develop an application to search recursively for all Java source files containing a particular string token within a particular directory. Include a SWING user interface from which the user will be able to choose a root directory from the local machine and enter the string token to be searched. The user will have the ability to start, stop, monitor, pause, or resume the Search task. The final user interface should be like</p>  </body> </html>
