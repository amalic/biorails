    h1.  The Catalogue
    
    h2. Overview
    
    <div style="float:left;padding-right:10px;">
    
    !/images/catalogue.jpg!
    
    </div>
    
    The catalogue is a sophisticated and powerful dictionary management system.  From here conceptual namespaces can be defined, multiple systems linked in and ontologies can be mapped between the corporate standards and local usages.  The catalogue also provides the building blocks for the creation of studies and running experiments.
    
    h2. Tabs 
    
    The tabs are arranged in order of dependency, left to right:
    
    h3. "Context":/menu/catalog/context
    
    The Context provides the conceptual namespaces for the BioRails implementations.  These namespaces are the terminologies used by the application when implemented in a particular domain such as pre-clinical research or a screening cascade.  Each discipline has its own terminologies and the catalogue provides a place to define these ontologies.  
    
    The BioRails contexts can also be hierarchical which means that more complex dictionaries for cell lines and taxonomies can be supported.
    
    The best way to use contexts is think of how the data would be used in an assay definition. 
    
    h3. "Systems":/menu/catalog/systems
    
    All the *data systems* linked into this instance of BioRails are listed in Systems. For each systems a number number of Data Element can be defined to link in lookup list of values for display and use in data entry. For example there could be a link to the internal compounds model and separate external enterprise level compound registration systems. 
    
    h3. "Parameter Types":/menu/catalog/parameter_types
    
    Parameter types are a __high-level__ global parameter definition used to classify a type of data captured and handled in the system. Studies may add there own aliases and formats to this to further characterise their results. For example there may be a global parameter EC50 which in a study is aliased to IC50. Or in other cases the parameter type of Compounds may be linked to difference source lists of valid values. 
    
    h3. "Parameter Roles":/menu/catalog/roles
    
    These are used to classify parameter type usage in a process. For example it may be a raw input value or a output of the process.
    
    h3. "Study Stages":/menu/catalog/stages
    
    Study Stages are used to partition the protocols used in a study into a number of target stages to help with reporting and management. For example a screening cascade would have stages of  
    
    # Primary
    # Confirmation
    # Dose Response
    # Profile 
    
    stages. In the study forms counts and summary statistics are presented in terms of these stages.
    
    h3. "Data Types":/menu/catalog/datatypes
    
    These are types of data the systems understands. To add more data types some coding will be needed, but feel free to modify the name and description.  You have to understand what __Values Classes__ mean before changing them!
    
    h3. "Data Formats":/menu/catalog/formats
    
    Beyond here lies dragons and the land of perl programmers (they often come together!). This is where data formats can be defined in terms of __regular expressions__ linked to a data type. This is a powerful method of client field validation as seen in the data entry sheet. The regular expressions is tested after each key press in data entry in Javascript on the client.

    h1. Inventory
    
    h2. Introduction
    
    Inventory is what is tested (directly or indirectly) in studies.  Inventory can be anything from abstract compounds, batch references to physical, bar-coded samples or perhaps animals.  There are no assumptions made about what can be tested although the default set up is for compounds, batches and samples.
    
    BioRails supports multiple inventories from multiple sources (integrated through "Systems":/menu/catalog/systems in the "Catalogue":/menu/Catalogue).  This means that there may be internal inventory for the samples and plates created for the experiments, or external plate management systems linked in and made available for testing.  BioRails also supports interrelationships between inventory.  For example, There may be a number of batches available for a specific compound.
    
    h2. Tags
    
    h3. "Overview":/menu/inv/show
    
    The overview will show a summary of all the different types of inventory, number of compounds, batches and plates/samples in each defined inventory for example.  There will also be information on the usage of the inventory.
    
    <div style="float:left;">
    
    !/images/molecule.jpg!
    
    </div>
    
    h3. "Compounds":/menu/inv/compound
    
    Compounds are a window into an external compound registration system.  In this case "ChemAxon's Marvin":http://www.chemaxon.com/product/marvin_land.html has been used to generate images of the structure although any chemistry system can be mapped in.
    
    h3. "Batches":/menu/inv/batches
    
    The batches associated with the compounds are listed here.  This is an internal (child) repository, part of BioRails which means that new Batches of compounds can be registered and existing ones updates or deleted. 
    
    h3. "Libraries":/menu/inv/libraries
    
    The term library in this context refers to a collection of compounds related by either structure or activity. Compound libraries originate from the field of combinatorial chemistry, a technique for synthesis of large volumes of structurally related compounds using an automated methodology.
    
    Some libraries are also compiled based on the activity of the compounds. They are typically supplied by reagent suppliers who will market a set of molecules for a particular application area. For example a Kinase Library. This can be a great starting point for a medicinal chemistry program or as the basis for a screening campaign based on a novel target.
    
    Libraries are also referred to as screening libraries. This is because the intended application of the library is to screen it for activity against a set of targets. Screening libraries are commercially available from library suppliers such as MayBridge.

    h2. The Study\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A study is a scientific investigation into the effect of a compound on a biological system. In BioRails, the study provides the required level of organisation for running experiments.  There will be one or more experiments run in a study.  The experiments will use protocols defined in the study.  These protocols are in turn built against the study terminology which is mapped to the corporate dictionaries. Each study will have its own collection of annotations and reports.  The objective is to provide not only a method of capturing biological data but to provide the basis for generating fixed reports, metrics, and most importantly, study reports.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    <div style=\"float:left; padding-right:10px;\">\r\n\

    \r\n\
    </div>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h2. Organisation\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Study is organised into: \r\n \r\n\
    h3. \"Overview\":/menu/org/study\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A list of studies each with metrics describing the number of parameters used, the number of protocols registered and experiments run.   \r\n\
    \r\n\
    h3. \"Parameters\":/menu/org/params\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Parameters are the dictionaries against which protocols are built.  Each parameter has an assigned role is used to categorise them in reporting.  Each parameter has a unique name and is a type.  The parameters also have a unique alias which means that local/discipline terminologies can be used without conflicting with other research groups or the corporate dictionary.  Two good examples are:\r\n \r\n\
    # __Dose__ , a common term with different meanings by different groups.  Dose in screening campaigns is usually linked to the type concentration, in animal experiments it is usually mass per unit weight.  The same term employed differently.\r\n\
    # __xC50__,  there may be a number of implementations of the term IC50, such as EC50, IC-50, Each usage of the term is different but they can all be mapped to to the type xC50.  Different terms with the same meaning.          \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Parameters assigned to the study will inherit the data type assigned to the Parameter Type.  The format provides form validation in the data entry sheets preventing mistakes being made on data entry. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    h3. \"Protocols\":/menu/org/protocol\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Protocols form shows a list of protocols available within the study.  Like Studies, protocols can be imported or experted as XML documents.  Editing the study allows the user to set up a data entry sheet.  Each row of the protocol is a __context__.  A context may be a physical container like a plate or rack, or an abstract entity such as a compound or a treatment group.  The context can be extended with child contexts.  In this way a treatment group may contain a collection of animals, a plate a collection of samples, each with a collection of wells. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Each context supports a default number of rows. Parameters are dragged into each context  which will form the columns of the data entry sheet.  These columns can be populated with default values and made mandatory.\r\n  \r\n\
    h3. \"Timeline\":/menu/org/time\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The study Timeline provides a high level daily log of all the activities carried out in the study\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h3. \"Reports\":/menu/org/reports\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Any fixed reports that use *Study Name* as a parameter can be run directly from this tab.  Reports can also be defined here.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    h3. \"Notes\":/menu/org/notes\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A __table of contents__ of all the notes or annotations associated with the study, or elements of the study (such as experiments, protocols, compounds e.t.c.) can be viewed here.  "

    h1. Analysis & Reporting
    
    h2. Overview
    
    With all the data stored in a structured database, BioRails offers powerful _ad-hoc_ analysis/data-mining capabilities to supplement the built-in reports for KPI/KQI and canned reports available from the reports tabs on each functional domain ("Study/Reports":/menu/org/reports, "Inventory/Reports":/menu/reports/ etc)
    
    <div style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    !/images/human_brain.jpg!
    </div>
    
    h2. Objective
    
    The objective is to provide a tool with which users can build a query and output a tabulated report to applications such as "MS Excel":http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/default.aspx or "Spotfire Decisionsite":http://www.spotfire.com/.
    
    h3. Data Organisation
    
    The data in BioRails is partitioned into studies, each with their own terminology/ontology but which maps into global "parameter types":/menu/catalog/parameter_types.  This means that the terms used in different studies can be handled consistently in queries and data mining.  In addition, data is captured against protocols built against these parameters providing a powerful method of organising and drilling into data.
    
    h3. Special Challenges
    
    h4. Pivoting
    
    Once the correct data is identified by the scientist it needs to be pivoted correctly for the analysis tools.  This can be a major source of headaches for the analyst as many solutions require that the data is downloaded to the client and cleaned up before pivoting can occur.   It is important to provide some method of _in-situ_ pivoting so the data can be extracted in the correct format for the analysis tools.
    
    <div style="float:right;padding-left:10px;">
    !/images/technical_design_elements.jpg!
    </div>
    
    
    h4. Unit Handling
    
    BioRails handles base units and conversion factors which means that queries can be run against dimensioned data without the worry of picking up values with different units.
    
    h3. Recording Analysis
    
    Well this should be deferred to analysis tools where possible.  However, the results of analysis should be stored.  This may be as a type of task or an annotation.
    
    h2. Key Analytical Reports
    
    # SAR: Structure Activity Relationship)
    # Compound Profile: Everything about that compound)
    # Pregression: Tracking the progression of compounds through the system
    # Patient Profile: Everything that has happened to the patient against which experiments were run (large animal/clinical)

    A study report is a write up of a study.  This report is a mixture of 
    
    # Tables of data extracted from the database
    # Graphics and charts of the data
    # Statistical Analysis of the data
    # The conclusions written by the responsible scientist (study director)
    
    h2. Generating a Study Report in BioRails

    Tables of summary statistics or metrics can be regenerated in the report.  These statistics are live and will change with the underlying data so are always accurate at the point of refreshing the page.  *We may want to provide an automated refresh*.
    
    Individual records can be retrieved or all the records in a task, or all the records at a certain level of the hierarchy as defined by the protocol
    
    </div>
    
    h2. Additional Rendering
    
    The extracted data can be rendered in a number of different ways:
    
    h3. Plotted Data
    
    BioRails has a library of charting options.  These can be used to plot the data directly with no intermediate steps.
    
    !/charts/histogram/667! 
    
    h3. Spreadsheet Output
    
    To simplify the formatting of the report, the data can be output directly to a spreadsheet where it can be formatted _in-situ_ which is essential for scientists who do not know how to format their data until they extract it.
    
    h2. Secondary Analysis
    
    BioRails will provide an added level of analysis. for example fit charts and statistical reports could be generated as part of the output by adding the relevent plug-in.

    h1. Goldberg Setup
    
    h2. Overview
    
    This is where you will find all the Goldberg-specific administration and configuration features.  In here you can:
    
    * Set up Users.
    * Manage Roles and their Permissions.
    * Set up any Controllers and their Actions for your application.
    * Edit the Content Pages of the site.
    * Adjust Goldberg's system settings.

    </div>
    
    h2. Users
    
    You can set up Users with a username, password and a Role.
    
    h2. Roles and Permissions
    
    A User's Permissions affect what Actions they can perform and what Pages they can see.  And because each Menu Item is based either on a Page or an Action, the Permissions determine what Menu Items the User can and cannot see.
    
    A Role is a set of Permissions.  Roles are assigned to Users.  Roles are hierarchical: a Role can have a parent Role; and if so it will inherit the Permissions of the parent Role, and all its parents.
    
    h2. Controllers and Actions
    
    To execute any Action, a user must have the appropriate Permission.  Therefore all Controllers and Actions you set up for your Rails application need to be entered here, otherwise no user will be able to execute them.
    
    You start by setting up the Controller and assigning it a Permission.  The Permission will be used as the default for any Actions invoked for that Controller.
    
    You have the option of setting up specific Actions for the Controllers.  You would want to do that if the Action were to appear as a Menu Item, or if it were to have a different level of security to the default for the Controller.
    
    h2. Content Pages
    
    Goldberg has a very simple CMS built in.  You can create pages to be displayed on the site, possibly in menu items.
    
    h2. Menu Editor
    
    Once you have set up your Controller Actions and Content Pages, you can put them into the site's menu using the Menu Editor.
    
    In the Menu Editor you can add and remove Menu Items and move them around.  The security of a Menu Item (whether the user can see it or not) depends on the Permission of the Action or Page attached to that Menu Item.
    
    h2. System Settings
    
    Go here to view and edit the settings that determine how Goldberg operates.
