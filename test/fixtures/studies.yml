    Collection of protocols to support BAL Analysis.
    
    A protocol has been defined for a treatment group.  Multiple tasks generated from this protocol can then be consolidated in Excel where they are summarised and a macro is run to generate graphs and stats.  A set of prism files are generated which can then be loaded as content against the experiment which in turn are used to build the final study report.
