    "In a decision that could have far-reaching implications, a federal court in 
    Pennsylvania has held that the California arbitration clause in the 'take it
     or leave it' clickwrap agreement on the Second Life website is unconscionable, 
    and therefore unenforceable. In its decision (pdf) in Bragg v. Linden Research,
     Inc., No. 06-4925 (E.D. Pa. May 30, 2007), the Court concluded that the Second 
    Life 'terms of service' seek to impose a one-sided dispute resolution scheme that 
    tilts unfairly, 'in almost all situations,' in Second Life's favor. As a result, 
    the case will stay in Pennsylvania federal court, instead of being transferred to
     an arbitration forum in Californi

    "In a decision that could have far-reaching implications, a federal court in 
    Pennsylvania has held that the California arbitration clause in the 'take it
     or leave it' clickwrap agreement on the Second Life website is unconscionable, 
    and therefore unenforceable. In its decision (pdf) in Bragg v. Linden Research,
     Inc., No. 06-4925 (E.D. Pa. May 30, 2007), the Court concluded that the Second 
    Life 'terms of service' seek to impose a one-sided dispute resolution scheme that 
    tilts unfairly, 'in almost all situations,' in Second Life's favor. As a result, 
    the case will stay in Pennsylvania federal court, instead of being transferred to
     an arbitration forum in Californi
