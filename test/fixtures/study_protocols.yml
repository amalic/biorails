  description: "Plasma samples\r\n\
    The plasma samples should be taken into K3EDTA tubes and centrifuged at 10-15 min. at 2000 G (5\xC2\xB0C)\r\n\
    Store the samples in polypropylene tubes (order no.M32022, Micronic, In vitro A/S)\r\n\
    The tubes should be closed with a break-off capband (order no. M82605, Miconic, In Vitro A/S)\r\n\
    A minimum of 200 \xC2\xB5L plasma is required\r\n\
    Place the samples systematically in a rack (order no. M22504, Micronic, In Vitro A/S)\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Brain samples\r\n\
    Whole brain samples should be weigh out and stored in 12 mL tubes from VWR International (Article No. BDAA352059)\r\n\
    For mice the whole brain should be used and for rats \xC2\xBD brain should be used \r\n\
    The brains should be weighed out and taken down at this sampleinfo\r\n\
    Label all tubes with labels from Cils (40 x17 mm, cat.no. E45-A8735), please ask for the wordtemplate\r\n\
    ALL samples should be labelled with information of study no., dose, group no., time (nominel) and compound no.\r\n\
    Store the samples at -80\xC2\xB0C\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If actual time is considerable different from nominel time please write the actual time after dosing  \r\n\
    please send this infosheet to the mailbox: exposure\r\n"
