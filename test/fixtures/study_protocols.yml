    Implement a new assay against the submitted target.  There are a number of outputs for this process, an SOP linked to a study design which includes a collection of protocols used to capture data.
    Assay development start point is acceptance of the validated target.  The end point is the implementation of the study design.

    This is an interesting protocol as in this case, the output of the process is the collection of protocols and SOPs used in the study.  The output will be to an asset, usually a word document describing the assay.  There may be some secondary protocol used for calculation of assay robustness for example.
